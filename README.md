# CLI_Application-Dominion
A basic CLI application to help manage games of Dominion and its expansions (https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion).

## Purpose
This app will allow you to create and save sets of Kingdom cards for Dominion. Additionally, it features a 
quick setup option. This will allow you to enter in how many players you have, choose one of your premade 
kingdom card sets, and will dynamically inform you which cards you need and how many of them! 
Bureaucratic tasks taken care of, so you can be an efficient ruler.

## Installation
You will need to run $ bundle install from your local directory of this application for it to function!
At that point run the runner.rb file and you will be well on your way to overseeing your dominion. 

## Usage
Get your empire sprawl under control. Just follow the commands and our app will get you to every 
administrative fire that needs your help.*

*Dominion board game only. Deck RNG outside of scope.

## Contributing
This project was put together by two newly smelted Software Engineers at Flatiron School in Denver. 
(Yet to be forged in the vigors of their full education.)
After three weeks of learning, they put this together in about two and a half days.
